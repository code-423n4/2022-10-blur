[10/06/2022 23:20] aviggiano
I have a question: is the `FeeMechanism` implemented somewhere? has it been deprecated, or is it just out of scope? I see some references to it on the `scripts/deploy.ts` file, but can't find it anywhere

[10/07/2022 14:13] aga7hokakological
yes plz


[10/07/2022 16:22] toad#4695
If a maker opts in to oracle cancellations, their order requires a recent oracle signature in order to be executed. So when a taker attempts to match their order, they have to request our oracle for a valid signature at the current block number. Assuming the maker hasn’t cancelled, the oracle will give a signature, but due to latency, low gas priority, etc the transaction may not get executed until block n+1, n+2,… So the block range just gives extra buffer for the oracle signature to be valid even if a few blocks have passed

{Reactions}

[10/07/2022 17:40] trustminimised
Do you have an idea of what the typical blockrange value will be in production?


[10/07/2022 17:43] mathewthomas_
Hi, Can some one give a link to the white paper of Blur Exchange, please?


[10/07/2022 17:50] toad#4695
The signature should only need to be live for a few minutes so I'd say around the order of 10


[10/07/2022 17:50] toad#4695
Unfortunately, we don't have a whitepaper yet


[10/07/2022 17:51] trust90
The ERC1967Proxy implementation will only be used for BlurExchange?


[10/07/2022 17:51] toad#4695
Correct

Why are there two methods (one for ask, the other for bid) in IMatchingPolicy? Standard implementations are the same. What differences can an implementation do between ask and bid?

{Reactions}
👍 

[10/07/2022 19:32] toad#4695
There are possible matching policies we would like to add in the future that would operate differently depending on if the seller is the maker or the taker


[10/07/2022 21:34] cryptphi
how are orders created?


[10/07/2022 21:39] toad#4695
We have a live orderbook storing listings and users can find listings and produce matching taker orders to execute

[10/08/2022 05:21] rustyrabbit
can you give some examples of matching policies you're thinking of. Just to see what impact they could have on the current code.

[10/08/2022 18:11] Franfran#5067
what's the exact use of bulk signatures ?


[10/08/2022 18:47] toad#4695
@RustyRabbit  A couple we have considered are collection bids and trait bids. For collection bids the buyer just wants to match a sell with a matching collection address. For trait bids we’d have to create merkle trees for different traits. The buyer would include the root hash in extraParams to specify the trait tree and the seller would put a merkle proof in extraParams to prove their token is in the trait tree


[10/08/2022 18:48] toad#4695
Yes anyone can call it, as long as it has the appropriate signatures

{Reactions}

[10/08/2022 18:49] toad#4695
Bulk listing allows users to authorize multiple listings with one signature, instead of having to resign each one

[10/08/2022 21:25] trustminimised
@toad Do you have any examples of how `Order.extraParams` will be used?


[10/08/2022 21:46] Franfran#5067
@trustminimised


[10/08/2022 21:47] trustminimised
Is that not `extraSignature` from the `Input` struct?


[10/08/2022 21:47] Franfran#5067
Similar to Opensea, there is an orderbook which means that sellers and buyers will place orders by signing a message containing the order. This order book is stored off chain and they are matched on chain with `execute`

[10/08/2022 21:48] Franfran#5067

[10/08/2022 21:49] Franfran#5067
Maybe it's for later policies ? Let the master answer

> The buyer would include the root hash in extraParams to specify the trait tree and the seller would put a merkle proof in extraParams to prove their token is in the trait tree 
Looks like it was gone over a bit above.

So basically later flexibility.

[10/09/2022 06:18] penguin4238
really like the design for ExecutionDelegate


[10/09/2022 06:51] penguin4238
but is there a default value for revokedApproval[msg.sender]? in case a user has never grant or revoke approve for this contract @toad


[10/09/2022 07:17] dinesh11g
hi


[10/09/2022 07:31] Franfran#5067
It's false by default https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/control-structures.html#scoping-and-declarations


[10/09/2022 07:36] koolexc
What's the idea of having 'execute' public? I'm aware that anyone can call it. but what's the mechanism used to run the exchange? maybe a schedular to pick orders and match?


[10/09/2022 08:13] penguin4238
nope, i have written a test case, the test case failed if we do not grant at first

{Reactions}
💯 

[10/09/2022 08:19] dinesh11g
how many got bugs?


[10/09/2022 08:24] Franfran#5067
it's false by default, as a matter of fact in the transfer functions in the Delegate it's checking if the revoking is indeed false


[10/09/2022 08:38] penguin4238
yeah, that the case


[10/09/2022 08:38] Franfran#5067
So, you don't need to grant it first


[10/09/2022 08:38] Franfran#5067
it should work as is


[10/09/2022 08:50] rustyrabbit
I think maybe the term `revokeApproval()` could be misleading in this case. Maybe @penguin means the user still has to approve the `ExecutionDelagate.sol`  on the NFT. 
`grantApproval()` and `revokedApproval()` is something you execute on the `ExecutionDelagate.sol` and has to be seen more as a way for a user to tell the `ExecutionDelagate.sol` contract not to use __any__ of the  `msg.sender`'s NFTs, even the ones that still have an approval set for `ExecutionDelagate.sol`. It's sort of an "override all approvals" function.


[10/09/2022 09:17] penguin4238
yeah, my fault, the test case has been affected by previous case


[10/09/2022 09:40] saksham#7993
Noob question but do you guys use some sort of pre built templates for gas and QA stuff cause writing similar cases and stuff again and again for different contest seems a headache

hi @toad a question about _validateSignatures, it seems that if im the order's trader, it always shortcut and return true. Lets say a case  has the expirationTime set to 0 and then the order owner canceled the oracle offchian, however, the order's trader can still operate the order?


[10/09/2022 16:17] 0xmatt#3768
There are two orders being executed, sell.order and buy.order. You can change sell.order and buy.order values like sell.order.trader == msg.sender but you effectively become the seller and transfers act as though you're the seller - ie draw money from the buyer (you) to seller (also you), transfer token from seller (you) to buyer (also you)

Sus


[10/09/2022 22:03] penguin4238
yeah, but i mean it the trade does has to be the seller or buyer, it could be a third-party address assign by the seller or buyer i suppose. If this is the case, then i dnt know how order owner cancel the oracle offchian, but i still feel it is possible to make misunderstanding here, wat is ur opinion? @toad


[10/09/2022 22:24] Franfran#5067
It doesn't matter if the user executes his own order because it's arbitrary data, but it would if other users could


[10/09/2022 22:27] toad#4695
Right, if the trader is executing the order no signature is needed. Even if they previously had a signed order that the cancelled through the oracle system, because they could easily just set the expirationTime to something 15 minutes in the future and the result would be the same

[11/23/2022 01:51] alextheentreprenerd
Honestly was high quality stuff, just needs more findings


[11/23/2022 01:51] birdy0219
Oh I'm not, this audit was early last month, still working on it. Was glad to participate in a consensys diligence bootcamp through secureum race results and want to start applying that knowledge, so I'm not 100% manual brain work


[11/23/2022 01:52] birdy0219
What did you think of the gas report? Done a few optimisation reports like that since, so guessing they haven't scored well either


[11/23/2022 01:53] alextheentreprenerd
One of the most unique reports, but needs more savings, just add some of the more bread and butter stuff or make sure you're saving disproportionate amounts of gas


[11/23/2022 01:54] alextheentreprenerd
You basically missed a big savings, else you'd have prob written the best report


[11/23/2022 01:54] alextheentreprenerd
Def go check when the report is out

With the new system, it's weird to see 1 point for gas optimizations, before it often was 100, but now I'm probably behind the times, I'll wait for the report to study new techniques.


[11/23/2022 02:32] alextheentreprenerd
You want to keep in mind that we always prio runtime gas savings, ultimately the protocol spent 50k, they can spend 1k if it saves 10 USD per every person using the protocol


[11/23/2022 02:35] birdy0219
Good point, I was curious if there was a priority between the two, personally I agree, spend more at deployment to save the end users fees

Without backstage access, is there a way to see your invalid reports? As a way to improve yourself to see what you did wrong ? Even after the report is released, because as far as I know you can only see valid findings.


[11/23/2022 09:19] koolexc
Same question here


[11/23/2022 09:23] 0xsorrynotsorry
There is no way to see your submission prior to the report unless you have the backstage role. And if you want to see the status of all your submissions, you can check the contest GH repo in data view and check your handle. Here is an **example**: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder-findings/tree/main/data
@Koolex 
Also please be reminded that the Judges can invalidate findings without adding a comment at the submission page.


[11/23/2022 09:26] koolexc
Thank you. It's my first contest and I would like to learn from my mistakes. 
I know for sure there was at least 1 issue totally wrong, couldn't withdraw it. Was too late.


[11/23/2022 09:27] koolexc
So I can see what was invalid regardless of the comments? From what I understand


[11/23/2022 09:35] 0xsorrynotsorry
Yes, you can see all your submissions and the status being invalidated, downgraded, or upgraded.


[11/23/2022 09:37] koolexc
thank you! . maybe I am missing something here. 
trying to access this https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/tree/main/data
but it gives 404. is my link wrong?


[11/23/2022 09:39] 0xsorrynotsorry
Yeah, what I mean is you can only see those after the report. The repo will be in public status then. (now in private)

Having a hard time as I cannot answer all the DMs

The TL;DR is:
- Did you code the exploit? 
- Did you just point to it or show a real attack?

And lastly, did you send enough findings of enough quality to offer a good report to the sponsor

If you didn't do one of these, you should always do it until you're good enough to skip some of it

Will eventually reply

So QA report really needs to be a sizable list of findings, 'or else don't bother'?

I've reported small stuff in the past in QA where I didn't really expect much of a reward for it, but thought it would be useful for the sponsor to have a full list of small items where no one will have them all but between all wardens combined you'd have a comprehensive list.
Good to know that effort isn't needed.

Some wardens spend the entire time of the contest putting together the huge, high-quality report. And it's a bit of a shame that their bounty was smaller due to a lot of low quality reports, with 1-2 findings.

{Reactions}
👍 

[11/23/2022 14:59] neko_nyaa
I agree with this one, sometimes I like to put together small reports for a list of useful things that can be overlooked at well (e.g. clearly low severity, but unique findings).

Historically C4 has used traditional submitting for low findings, also rewarding unique findings in the process (with the same decay formula as well). There are some reports where the quality of it comes from the findings itself, but not its full content.

I do agree though is that only the reports that stands out on its own should be grade A, and anything that shows full effort and reasonable quality is at least grade B, and coming from backstage I can tell that some judges share the same view.


[11/23/2022 15:01] neko_nyaa
It may be helpful to introduce some mechanism where multiple reports are selected (e.g. for its overall quality, or for some of its unique issues), not for rewarding, but simply for curating the best possible QA report coming from everyone's input


[11/23/2022 15:02] neko_nyaa
e.g. grade A reports combined or such, or anything that the sponsors commented helpful


[11/23/2022 15:15] rustyrabbit
This probably sounds harsh, but I feel like QA reports aren't worth the effort, especially if you take into account the risk to other findings with new penalty system. 
Although I don't really have visibility on how much a good QA report is rewarded. I'm just going by the numbers I see.

{Reactions}

[11/23/2022 15:20] c3phas.
Fyi QA always has a bigger budget compared to Gas. The issue is mostly people focus on non critical issues and less on low findings


[11/23/2022 15:21] pfapostol
for the best report now you can get about +-$1000 depending on the pool

If you look at the winning reports,the quality is extremely high,the border of some of their findings in relation to mediums is quit small


[11/23/2022 15:23] rustyrabbit
ok $1000 is very decent, but if it's only the best QA report that gets it then the effort of the other 30 wardens is futile.


[11/23/2022 15:25] pfapostol
the situation when many wardens who did not put an effort received rewards was worse. IMHO.


[11/23/2022 15:26] rustyrabbit
The new approach will probably/hopefully rectify that situation.


[11/23/2022 15:27] pfapostol
now it is true contest, it must be competitive. And hard enough to justify the payouts.

Can I request that you move this discussion to another channel? This channel is intended for discussions specific to the Blur contest.

With Blur bids now live, when can we expect the report?


[12/06/2022 19:41] alextheentreprenerd
Code for Bids was not part of this contest, am not aware of any audit for that code, don't have insight into when the report will be out

Why is https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/241 marked as QA?  Shouldn't this be a Med at least?

Only difference from https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity-findings/issues/43 is that it requires a user to select the "wrong" policy.

Feels like a huge downgrade for a valid risk


[12/09/2022 16:41] alextheentreprenerd
Your submission about the amount being 1 was awarded here:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/236

The other submission was interpreted for the ability to use different policies, which is something that the end user can do. This is logically equivalent to a person sending tokens to a random address. 

It's their power to do so, an for those cases we refer to this rule:
https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues/53

The only alternative was to mark your 2 submissions as dup of each other per this: https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues/8

So I technically took your side, but in computing the QA it didn't get enough point


[12/09/2022 16:50] ladboy233
Yeah Alex is really nice and always takes the Warden side (he really does. Appreciate it).


[12/09/2022 16:51] ladboy233
💯


[12/09/2022 17:34] soosh4618
Just to be clear, I'm not complaining, just confused. 

This finding is a totally different issue from the amount=1 issue. If issue 236 is fixed, issue 241 is still present. 

Issue 236 is about ERC1155 transfers being fixed to 1.
Issue 241 is about ERC1155 transfer being treated as ERC721 transfer.

I don't think its duplicate as fixing one issue does not fix the other.

Also with regards to user error - this isn't like sending tokens to a random address. It is a very simple mistake for a non-technical user to make, it requires the trader to know that their ASSET token supports both ERC721 and ERC1155 in order to not make such a mistake.

From: https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria, "Low risk (e.g. assets are not at risk: state handling, function incorrect as to spec, issues with comments)". I definitely disagree that the finding would be classified under this.


[12/09/2022 17:40] soosh4618
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/240 was also marked dupe of 666. I'm unsure of how it should really be classified, **the issue exists only if another issue is fixed**.  This is more of one vulnerability preventing another vulnerability? If fixing the first will allow the other vulnerability to occur.


[12/09/2022 20:00] alextheentreprenerd
What do you think is the impact if they use the wrong policy?


[12/10/2022 01:37] soosh4618
I'd consider it loss of funds since the trader receives less than expected. It would appear as though they were buying N tokens on the UI and on metamask with the amount of N, but they only receive 1 after the tx


[12/10/2022 01:43] alextheentreprenerd
If I interpreted it that way, then I would have marked it as the dup of 666

If you send the dup of the same issue twice it's not counted for awarding


[12/10/2022 01:43] alextheentreprenerd
Only 1 instance would be counted


[12/10/2022 01:48] soosh4618
But I don't get why its dupe! These are different ways to achieve loss of funds impact. I think the issues are different because the method of exploitation, and recommendations for fix are also different. If we go by impact only, then wardens are only able to be awarded for one type of impact per contest?


[12/10/2022 01:59] alextheentreprenerd
You can read a pretty nuanced discussion on this specific topic here:
https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues/8


[12/10/2022 02:01] alextheentreprenerd
You can also read my exact reason to the above, which doesn't just apply to you but to the finding of Token that is both 1155 and 721 here:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/241#issuecomment-1295661178


[12/10/2022 02:52] birdy0219
Alex can I DM you?


[12/10/2022 02:55] birdy0219
Disregard, finally worked out how to find my feedback, thank you for taking the time to comment


[12/10/2022 03:53] soosh4618
I guess the point of disagreement is that you found the findings to be similar and I think they are different.
https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues/8 - The examples given here are mostly some pattern being found in multiple areas of code should be bulked.
E.g. The pattern of "Lack of address(0) check" in multiple areas of the codebase should be submitted as one finding

I chose to separate my finding - 236, 241 because they have a **different pattern** and **different recommendations for fix**.

The recommendation for 666 is _"Policies used for ERC1155 tokens should return and consider the amount of tokens set for the order."_  Which would not have fixed 241. If I had bulked 241 and 236, and it gets marked dupe of 666, sponsor would only see 666 recommendation and not 241.

The fix for issue 241 is in `StandardPolicyERC721` not in `StandardPolicyERC1155`

Unpatched (contest code):
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur/blob/main/contracts/matchingPolicies/StandardPolicyERC721.sol#L12-L36
Deployed:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000006411739DA1c40B106F8511de5D1FAC#code

```
+ (makerAsk.amount == 1) &&
+ (takerBid.amount == 1) &&
```

If the sponsor only implemented the recommendation in issue 666, they would have missed out on this fix and would still be vulnerable to 241.

I do agree 240 and 236 be bulked but 241 definitely isn't similar to 666.

Anyways, I do respect your time so I won't push this further.

I agree with you and suffered a similar situation in another contest, where the fix and pattern of the issue my report was marked as duplicate of was clearly different, and the fix for one didn’t solve the other. In my case the judge deliberated and decided to mark it as a duplicate. A bit frustrating, tbh, I think there should be a revision of these way of judging.


[12/11/2022 12:06] 0x_serial_coder
@Alex The Entreprenerd Hello sir, this was my first contest, and I got some naive questions.

Q1: 

My finding (https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/739) was downgraded to NC, as highlighted in the figure #1. But I cannot figure out the reason behind this action in the Readme you were referring to or anywhere else. 

Could you please elaborate more on this?

Q2: 

What criteria for selecting which findings should be tagged `invalid` and/or `unsatisfactory`? 

As per the figure #2, that finding was also downgraded to NC, but it was not tagged with `invalid` or `unsatisfactory`.

Q3: 

In case the finding is downgraded to NC but not tagged with `invalid` or `unsatisfactory` like the Q2, that finding would be eligible for awarding?

Q4: 

From the C4 docs (figure #3), they state the following: `Wardens overstating the severity of QA issues (submitting low/non-critical issues as med/high in order to angle for higher payouts) will have their scores reduced by judges.`.

Does that mean if my findings were flagged `invalid` or `unsatisfactory`, I would get a penalty on calculating the award?

I mean, the more invalid findings I get, the more penalty points will affect my award, right?

Q5: 

From the competitive result (figure #4), I cannot catch up with the exact formula used to calculate the award for each warden, as many wardens got the same findings, but they got pretty different awards.

Where can I find the specs of this awarding formula? (The C4 docs cannot answer this question)

Thanks for your time. I really appreciate your contribution. 🙏

Q1: 
I downgraded the finding relating to return value of ERC20 after Backstage (Post-Judging Triage) flagged to me that the token for the protocol is WETH (on mainnet) and it was explicitly stated in the Readme.

For this reason you don't need to check the return value



Q2: 
The finding is downgraded, then your QA is scored, I score each QA that I don't scrap (not your case) via the following process:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZMVYBadmvgjxnqmLExi9pRE_qOAPtVELioZBf856qz8/edit?usp=sharing

Q3: 

If a finding is downgraded and valid, it's awarded with it's new severity. in the case of L / NC / R that would be QA

Q4: 

If I scrap your finding as insulting it should be obvious, that was not the case

Q5: 

See Q2, then check their QAs you'll see that the specific finding was just one of many others, which contributed to a stronger score for their QA report


[12/11/2022 16:25] 0x_serial_coder
Thanks for your answers. 🙏 

But, I still don't understand the criteria for selecting which findings should be tagged `invalid` and/or `unsatisfactory`.

Let's consider the following four findings (Figures #1 - #4) which were marked `duplicate`:

- Finding #1 (https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/772) was tagged `invalid` and `unsatisfactory`

- Finding #2 (https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/541) was tagged `invalid` and `unsatisfactory`

Whereas,

- Finding #3 (https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/634) was neither tagged `invalid` nor `unsatisfactory`

- Finding #4 (https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-blur-findings/issues/373) was neither tagged `invalid` nor `unsatisfactory`

Does that mean the first two findings are not eligible for receiving awards, whereas the second two findings are eligible? 🙏

You would need to apply Q-2 to your own score vs the top report

You got a 
3L 1NC -> 16 points

The best one got 58, I think I used less as the divisors but you can see that if you scored less than 50% I would close as C scored


[12/11/2022 16:29] alextheentreprenerd
as for the penalties, this is in discussion


[12/11/2022 16:30] alextheentreprenerd
I believe you may be the only warden that writes too much for some reports.
But I don't think I would punish your submission, however for QA I only have the C score which also applies the Unsatisfactory label

QA reports are judged as an aggregate, it's not on a finding by finding basis. This should explain why some are open and closed (despite being the same)

@Alex The Entreprenerd is there a plan to share the score for each issue in the git?


[12/11/2022 16:51] alextheentreprenerd
All reports are scored at the bottom of the page, you can compare your score vs the top report and it should be trivial


[12/11/2022 16:51] alextheentreprenerd
In the future, once this aspect of judging is added to the extension if probably will be made available
